                    Obtaining metal pogs is a little different than collecting normal pogs.
                    Copper pogs can be earned through basic things like small favors or doing good on an assignment. 
                    Silver pogs can be earned through trading 5 copper pogs. Also silver pogs can be earned by doing bigger favors and attending after schools events such as prom, open house, or homecoming.
                    Golden pogs can be earned through trading 10 silver pogs. Also golden pogs allow you to ask Mr.Smith for a resonable favor.
                </td>
                <td>
                    To earn pogs phsically you can sweep/clean your row including the mouses and keyboards. 
                    You can also organize the chairs, clean the kitchen and meeting tables in the back of the room. 
                    Good behavior, favors, utilizing the phone box, or a serious attempt to answer a question asked mid lesson are also good ways to earn pogs physically.

                    2 of the main things you'll need is filament and a 3d printer. 
                    3d printers can be bought off Amazon or Newegg, and can be found at walmart or Best Buy.
                    Filament can easily be bought off Amazon or Newegg, but can also be found at Walmart.
                    Next, you need to use Gimp to create a png of your pog.
                    If you're making your pog in class you'll need to pay Mr.Smith 30 pogs and provide him with your png.
                    Otherwise you'll need to import the png into inkscape and use trace bitmap to turn it into an svg file.
                    Finally, you'll need to import your svg file into Fusion 360. 
                    Also, Mr.Smith allows the option of custom 3d printing which has a negotiable price(same with chairs) based on size, color, and time.
